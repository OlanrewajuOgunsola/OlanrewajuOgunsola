# Olanrewaju Ogunsola – Cybersecurity Manager | SOC & Threat Detection Specialist  

Passionate about **defensive security, SOC operations, SIEM optimization, threat detection, and cloud security**.  
Open to global opportunities in **Security Operations, Incident Response, and Cybersecurity Leadership**.  

Hello! I’m **Olanrewaju Ogunsola**, a CISM-certified cybersecurity professional with over 7 years of experience securing enterprise infrastructures across finance, healthcare, and technology. My expertise lies in **building and leading SOC operations**, leveraging frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK** to enhance detection and response, and strengthening security posture through proactive monitoring, risk mitigation, and SIEM integration.  

This repository gathers my **hands-on lab projects, detection use cases, and security frameworks** that reflect my technical depth, operational mindset, and commitment to **building resilient, business-aligned security programs**.

## Project Highlights  

### SOC Foundations  
- **Virtual SOC Lab Build** – Multi-VM environment (Windows, Linux, pfSense, Security Onion) for log aggregation and monitoring  
- **Splunk & Security Onion Dashboards** – SIEM-driven detection and correlation across multiple log sources  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Hunt Sprint** – ATT&CK Navigator queries mapped to detection use cases  

### Incident Detection & Response  
- **Suricata IDS Deployment** – Signature-based intrusion detection with real-world alerting  
- **Honeypot Deployment** – Capturing and analyzing attacker behavior for SOC enrichment  
- **Linux Permissions Audit** – Identifying misconfigurations and escalating detections into SOC alerts  

### Vulnerability & Risk Management  
- **Vulnerability Assessment** – Network and web application scans with Nmap, Nessus, and Nikto  
- **Patch & Risk Prioritization** – CIA triage mapping and mitigation recommendations  
- **Security Policy Development** – Practical GRC alignment (AUP, Password, Access-Control policies)  

### Offensive Security (for Blue-Team Enrichment)  
- **Phishing Attack Simulation & Forensics** – Campaign metrics and email header analysis to tune DLP/EDR  
- **SQL Injection & DDoS Simulation** – Offense-driven detections for SOC alert tuning  
- **Malware Analysis Lab** – Building detection rules from static/dynamic analysis of malicious files
